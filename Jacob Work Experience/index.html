		Following our very successful walk HOME we are sponsoring the three rescued elephants now living in the beautiful conservation forest surrounding the village of Huay Pakoot in northern Thailand.  We are also offering guests the opportunity to see and spend time with the elephants and to stay with a Karen Hill Tribe family, where you can experience their ancient and fascinating culture.
		</h2>
		<h3 style="color:black">
		Mahouts are thrilled to be offering the unique opportunity to be welcomed into a Karen Hill Tribe home. Residing in a ‘home stay’, you can see for yourself how your hosts live and work; sharing stories, foraging for vegetables and cooking and eating together. Villagers are also happy to demonstrate skills such as weaving brightly coloured cloth and basket making.

			<h2 id="aboutWahouts">ABOUT MAHOUTS</h2>
			<h4 class="aboutText">
			We are a family, Sarah, Felix, Joe and Natasha. Together we have a passion for the natural world and animals. In 2008 we travelled to Thailand, part of this trip was spent at a volunteer project for working Elephants, and it was to be an experience that would change our lives forever. We learned so much about Elephants working in the tourist industry in Thailand. Life is really tough not only for the Elephants but also for their Mahouts (owners) and their families. Following on from the project we have spent a lot of time in trekking camps and have made life long bonds with many Mahouts and their families. They often live in very difficult conditions in small little huts with no running water available, life is really hard for them.
			</h4>
			<h4 style="color:black">
			Mahouts Elephant Foundation are providing financial support to the Karen Hill Tribe mahouts to enable them to remain in the village to look after their elephants, who live in the forest around the village. We are keen to keep the elephants as deep in this beautiful forest as possible, this prevents them roaming on farmers crops and risking being shot or poisoned and keeps people safe from running into an elephant. The elephants are left to forage and wander freely through the forest while their mahouts will trek out every day to check on them and ensure they don’t wander too far from their forest home.
